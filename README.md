# blocktrust

I want to bring transparency to bitcoin transactions and blockchains. Blockchains are immutable public ledger that can be audited, but hardly anyone keeps track of how money is moving around between wallets. Average daily bitcoin transaction volume is roughly $7,449,010,000 USD(1). Bitcoin wallet addresses are public, but it is not human readable. Do you want to find out how many bitcoins WikiLeaks received as donation and how they spend it? According to Wikileaks wallet address, they spent it all. As of April 20, 2018 - Wikileaks has mere 0.00001 BTC left in its wallet but they have received about 4,042.5 BTC as donation (2). How much is 4,042.5 BTC in US Dollars aggregated over time mapped to the exchange rate? How can we trust Wikileaks is ethically spending their funds? Can we track their spending pattern to find out who received all those bitcoins from Wikileaks? So many questions to unearth, but no easy ways to find answers. With my data pipeline using bitcoin blockhain data, let's follow the money!
